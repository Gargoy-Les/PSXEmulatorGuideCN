# 2.6 BIOS(基本输入输出系统)

On the PlayStation the BIOS displays the first screens (with the logos and that memorable sweeping tune) and starts the game from the CD drive. If no CD is present it displays a menu that can be used to manage the memory cards and play CDs. As a player that’s probably the only time you’d know there was a BIOS running.

在PlayStation上，BIOS显示初始屏幕(伴随着PS徽标和启动音)，并从CD驱动器启动游戏。如果当成没有CD，它将显示一个管理记忆卡和播放CD的菜单。对于普通玩家而言，这可能是他知道BIOS曾经运行过的唯一机会。

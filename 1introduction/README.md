# 1 序言

## 1.序言(Introduction)

This is my attempt at documenting my implementation of a PlayStation emulator from scratch. I’ll write the document as I go and I’ll try to explain as much as possible along the way. You can find the complete source of the emulator itself in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/simias/psx-rs).

这是我尝试记录从零实现PlayStation模拟器(emulator,也作仿真器)的过程。我将在写本文档时尽可能地详细解释。你可以在我的[GitHub仓库](https://github.com/simias/rustation)中找到模拟器本身的完整源代码。

Since my favourite pass time is to reinvent the wheel and recode things that already exist I decided that this time I might as well document it. This way maybe this time something useful will come out of it and it’ll give me the motivation to finish it.

由于我最喜欢通过重新发明轮子和重写已有的代码来消磨时间，我决定这次不妨把过程记录下来。这样也许会产生一些有用的东西，这也是我完成它的动力。

I will be using the Rust programming language but this is not meant as a Rust tutorial and knowledge of the language shouldn’t be necessary to follow this guide, although it won’t hurt.

我将使用Rust编程语言，而本文不是Rust教程。Rust的知识对遵循本指南并无必要。

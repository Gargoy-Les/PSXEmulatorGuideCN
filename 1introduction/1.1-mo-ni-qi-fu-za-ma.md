# 1.1 模拟器复杂吗？

Emulation requires some low-level knowledge about how computers work and some basics in electronics might help for certain things. Since this doc is meant as an introduction to emulation I’ll assume that the reader doesn’t bring anything with them beyond some decent programming skills. So don’t worry if you’re not familiar with registers, cache, memory-mapped IO, virtual memory, interrupts and other low-level fun: I’ll try to explain everything when needed. Emulators are a good introduction to low-level programming without having to bother with that pesky hardware in person!

硬件仿真(emulation)需要一些关于计算机如何工作的底层知识，电子学(electronics)的基础知识也许会有帮助。由于本文档是硬件仿真的介绍，我将假设读者没有基本的编程技巧以外的一切。所以，如果你不熟悉寄存器(registers)、高速缓存(cache)、内存映射I/O(memory-mapped IO)、虚拟内存(virtual memory,)、中断(interrupts)和其他底层知识，也不用担心，必要时会详细解释。模拟器(emulators)是初步学习底层编程的好材料，使我们不因硬件本身烦恼。

Since this is supposed to be a general guide about writing PlayStation emulators I won’t put the entire source code of the emulator here, only snippets relevant to the matter being discussed.

由于本文是编写PlayStation模拟器的通用指南，我不会把全部源代码放在这里，只摘录与当前内容有关的片段。

Finally, keep in mind that getting a PlayStation emulator even capable to run some games decently will require quite a lot of work. Don’t expect to play Final Fantasy VII on your brand new emulator in two days. If you want to start with something simpler to see if you have a taste for it you can search for Chip-8, Game Boy or NES emulation tutorials (by increasing complexity).

最后，使PlayStation模拟器能顺畅地运行游戏需要相当多的工作。不太可能几天就能在全新的模拟器上玩《最终幻想7》。如果你想从更简单的东西开始，并且也有兴趣，可以搜索Chip-8、Game Boy或NES模拟器教程（复杂度递增）。
